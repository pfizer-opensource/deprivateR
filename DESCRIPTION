Description: Provides a unified framework to building Area Deprivation Index (ADI), 
    Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and Neighborhood Deprivation Index (NDI)  
    deprivation measures and accessing related data from the U.S. Census Bureau 
    such as Gini coefficient data. Tools are also available for calculating percentiles,
    quantiles, and for creating clear map breaks for data visualization.
